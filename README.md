# Machine Learning Pipeline / 📚 Skills Take Away
1.**Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values,duplicate removal, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features if necessary.

2.**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the distribution of features, identify correlations, and relationships between variables.    

3.**Feature Engineering**: Transform existing ones to improve model performance and Feature Importances in Random Forest Model.             

4.**Model Training**: Train machine learning models such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, KNN and Logistic Regression using the processed data.

5.**Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6.**Hyperparameter Tuning**: Hyperparameter tuning (HalvingRandomSearchCV)

7.**Model Deployment**: Streamlit App Development
